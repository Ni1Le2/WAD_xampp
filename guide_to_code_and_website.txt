This is a guide to help you go through and understand the website functions and code better.

All operations send/receive data from the database that is provided by xampp. This database uses indizes as well as relational constraints to make sure the data is consistent and integrity is guaranteed.

Login:
- Website displays different pages/content depending if a user is logged in or not and also depending on which user is logged in
- Researcher users can be simple registered
- Conference Chair users are predefined. To access conference chair content/operations, log in as:
    email: nico.leng@web.de
    password: password
- the passwords are md5 encrypted so it is not (easily) possible to retrieve them from the database without knowing them
- the pages that differ are mainly: 
    Publications, New Papers (only conference chair), My Papers (only researcher), News (only conferene chair can add/remove news)
- remark: all users passwords are set to "password" (so I don't have to remember too many different passwords), thats why in the database they all look the same
